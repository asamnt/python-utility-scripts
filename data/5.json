        "description": "<p><strong>Comprehensive Course Description:</strong></p><p>The hottest buzzwords in the Big Data analytics industry are Python and Apache Spark. PySpark supports the collaboration of Python and Apache Spark. In this course, you’ll start right from the basics and proceed to the advanced levels of data analysis. From cleaning data to building features and implementing machine learning (ML) models, you’ll learn how to execute end-to-end workflows using PySpark.</p><p>Right through the course, you’ll be using PySpark for performing data analysis. You’ll explore Spark RDDs, Dataframes, and a bit of Spark SQL queries. Also, you’ll explore the transformations and actions that can be performed on the data using Spark RDDs and dataframes. You’ll also explore the ecosystem of Spark and Hadoop and their underlying architecture. You’ll use the Databricks environment for running the Spark scripts and explore it as well.</p><p>Finally, you’ll have a taste of Spark with AWS cloud. You’ll see how we can leverage AWS storages, databases, computations, and how Spark can communicate with different AWS services and get its required data.</p><p><strong>How Is This Course Different?</strong></p><p>In this <strong><em>Learning by Doing</em></strong> course, every theoretical explanation is followed by practical implementation.</p><p><br></p><p>The course ‘<strong>PySpark &amp; AWS: Master Big Data With PySpark and AWS</strong>’ is crafted to reflect the most in-demand workplace skills. This course will help you understand all the essential concepts and methodologies with regards to PySpark. The course is:</p><p>• Easy to understand.</p><p>• Expressive.</p><p>• Exhaustive.</p><p>• Practical with <em>live</em> coding.</p><p>• Rich with the state of the art and latest knowledge of this field.</p><p><br></p><p>As this course is a detailed compilation of all the basics, it will motivate you to make quick progress and experience much more than what you have learned. At the end of each concept, you will be assigned Homework/tasks/activities/quizzes along with solutions. This is to evaluate and promote your learning based on the previous concepts and methods you have learned. Most of these activities will be coding-based, as the aim is to get you up and running with implementations.</p><p>High-quality video content, in-depth course material, evaluating questions, detailed course notes, and informative handouts are some of the perks of this course. You can approach our friendly team in case of any course-related queries, and we assure you of a fast response.</p><p>The course tutorials are divided into <strong>140+</strong> brief videos. You’ll learn the concepts and methodologies of PySpark and AWS along with a lot of practical implementation. The total runtime of the HD videos is around <strong>16</strong> hours.</p><p><br></p><p>Why Should You Learn PySpark and AWS?</p><p>PySpark is the Python library that makes the magic happen.</p><p>PySpark is worth learning because of the huge demand for Spark professionals and the high salaries they command. The usage of PySpark in Big Data processing is increasing at a rapid pace compared to other Big Data tools.</p><p>AWS, launched in 2006, is the fastest-growing public cloud.

        "description": "<p><strong>Have you tried to learn JavaScript before?</strong></p>\n\n<p>JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to learn. You end up wasting time on out-of-date courses and incomplete YouTube tutorials that talk about a JavaScript features without showing how to use them when building real-world applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound familiar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I built this course to teach you how to build and launch your own JavaScript web applications. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp starts from scratch and builds up your knowledge of the JavaScript language. Yes, you’ll learn all the features of the language, but you’ll also learn how to use those features together to create a complete application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comprehensive course covers the modern ES6 and ES7 JavaScript features used in the real world. You’ll gain an understanding of the latest cutting-edge language features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting experience writing code on your own is a big part of learning JavaScript. <strong>That’s why I’ve included over 80 challenges designed to get you writing code, adding app features, and solving a wide range of problems.</strong> These challenges will give you the skills and confidence needed to create your own web application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no starter projects here. You’ll see what it takes to launch a JavaScript application, from the first line of code to the final deployed application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s this course for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. People who are brand new to JavaScript. </strong>You want to dive into the world of programming and learn JavaScript. This might be your first programming course, or maybe you’ve worked with other languages before. Either way, you’re ready for this bootcamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. People who currently use JavaScript but want a better sense of mastery over the language. </strong>You picked up little tricks and snippets of code because you needed to solve a problem. Now you’re ready to master JavaScript as well as explore the latest from ES6 and ES7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ll learn JavaScript by doing, not watching.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is not about watching videos, it’s about writing code. From the start, you’ll be building out each project from scratch as well as completing over 80 challenges designed to test and reinforce what you’ve learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the class, you’ll build three JavaScript applications:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The first app, a note-taking app, is our starter application. You’ll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript and see exactly what it takes to build a program that allows users to add, edit, delete, and save their notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The second app, a to-do application, you’ll be building on your own. This will test your skills and ensure that you have the real-world experience and problem-solving skills that are essential for writing JavaScript code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The last app, a hangman word game, is used to explore the world of asynchronous JavaScript. You’ll learn how to set up applications that rely on data from third-party services that can offer up dynamic, real-time information such as the user’s current location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay current in an ever changing world.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of JavaScript is always changing, and that’s why I work to keep this course as up-to-date as possible. You can join knowing you’ll be learning the fundamentals of the language as well as the new language features that keep coming out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course uses the latest language features from ES6 and ES7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no need to worry if you’re learning the right skills to land that JavaScript job or launch that JavaScript app. I’ve mapped out everything you need to know in an interactive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end, you’ll be able to build and launch your own applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There’s no better time to learn JavaScript.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve made a smart choice, because JavaScript is the most popular programming language out there. This is no exaggeration. This popularity and growth means more jobs and opportunities than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript powers the web. That means every company out there uses JavaScript, and the demand for JavaScript developers is only increasing. Companies from Google and Apple to Udemy itself all use JavaScript extensively. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript doesn’t stop with the web. It has quickly become a universal programming language capable of anything. JavaScript can be used to create desktop apps, server-side applications, native iOS/Android applications, and so much more. This course is your ticket into that ecosystem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get access to fast support if you get stuck.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s nothing worse than getting stuck ten hours into a course and not getting the help you need to continue. Getting stuck is part of the learning process. That’s why I’m here to answer every single question that comes my way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll work with you to get you unstuck and back on track. It’s one of the reasons students love taking my courses. Don’t take my word for it. Check out the student reviews below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This is the absolute best course I've taken on Udemy.

On top of all that, he responds to questions so quickly that you won't be stuck at any point.\"</em> - Tanya Gamarian</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\"The lessons are of high quality and even more important, he actually takes time to answer your questions!\"</em> - Thomas Vercamer</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guarantee that this is the most up-to-date and engaging JavaScript course available, and it comes with a Udemy 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t wait to see you on the inside!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>- Andrew</p>",

I will wait here...</p><p>...</p><p>Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?</p><p>Well, I'm here to teach you<strong> HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw</strong>, step-by-step.</p><p>So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.</p><p>But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to <strong>enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!</p></li><li><p>How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).</p></li><li><p>How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs</p></li><li><p>How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)</p></li><li><p>How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching</p></li><li><p>How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons</p></li><li><p>Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools</p></li></ul><p><strong>Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today!</strong></p><p><em>Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading...</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>[01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?</strong></p><p>Building websites allows you to do <strong>fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well</strong>. Web development is one of the <strong>most future-proof and highest-paying industries</strong> in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!</p><p>But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!</p><p>This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an <strong>all-in-one package</strong> that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[02] Why is this course so unique and popular?</strong></p><p><strong><em>Reason #1: The course is completely project-based</em></strong></p><p>Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by <strong>building actual projects</strong>! In the final project (<em>www.omnifood.dev</em>), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a <strong>fictional company</strong> that I made up just for the course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code</em></strong></p><p>Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire <strong>7-step process</strong> of building and launching our website project.</p><p>So the huge Omnifood project will teach you <strong>real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites</strong>: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.</p><p>On top of that, this course has a <strong>huge focus on beautiful design</strong>. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you</em></strong></p><p>With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be <strong>quite easy and fun to learn</strong>. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.</p><p>My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.</p><p>Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and <strong>designed the ideal course curriculum</strong> for every type of student. It's a <strong>unique blend</strong> of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[03] Why is this course so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Reason #1:</strong> I take time to <strong>explain every single concept</strong> that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (<strong>this is a course</strong>, not a tutorial)</p><p><strong>Reason #2:</strong> I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!</p><p><strong>Reason #3:</strong> There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually <strong>assimilate and practice</strong> what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[04] Here is what's also included in the package:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)</p></li><li><p>Professional English captions (not the&nbsp;auto-generated ones)</p></li><li><p>Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section</p></li><li><p>Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)</p></li><li><p>Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years</p></li><li><p>Free support in the course Q&amp;A</p></li><li><p>10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>[05] This course is for you if...</strong></p><ul><li><p>... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.</p></li><li><p>... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.</p></li><li><p>... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).</p></li></ul><p>Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So, does all of this sound great? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start your web development journey today!</em></strong></p>",
