No matter if you're working on a private or a professional development project, code evolves, changes and continuously gets improved. A clean version management structure is therefore key to successfully manage the progress of your projects.</p><p><strong>What is Git?</strong></p><p>Git is a 100% free version management tool, specifically created for and used by developers all over the world to manage project code history locally on their machines (Windows, macOS, Linux/Unix).</p><p><strong>What is GitHub?</strong></p><p>GitHub is an online service, it is also free for many use cases (an account is all you need) and brings Git's local \"file-tracking\" strengths to the cloud. Storing project code online, updating code, accessing other team members' code or collaborating on large scale projects inside your organization - all possible with the help of GitHub!</p><p><strong>Why Should I Know these Tools?</strong></p><p>Version control is key to manage projects efficiently so not knowing Git and GitHub makes your daily developer life a lot more complicated. The same apply if you're currently looking for a new job in the industry, version control is required in any developer projects these days, so not knowing Git &amp; GitHub puts you behind your competition!</p><p>Although Git and GitHub are user friendly, both come with their own logic and \"language\". Getting started can therefore be a bit cumbersome and this is where this course comes into play!</p><p><strong>What do I Learn in this Course?</strong></p><p>This course starts at the very basics, no prior Git or GitHub knowledge is required! You'll learn how to use Git and how to write Git commands in the Mac Terminal or the Windows Command Prompt (optional refreshers on both are also part of the course).</p><p>Starting with the first initialization of a so-called Git repository, we'll build up your knowledge step-by-step and understand the what &amp; why behind concepts like branches, commits, the staging area, merging &amp; rebasing, cloning, pushing &amp; pulling branches and a lot more!</p><p><strong>What's Inside this Course?</strong></p><ul><li><p>An optional Command Line Crash Course for both Windows &amp; MacOS users</p></li><li><p>Git Download &amp; Installation</p></li><li><p>Git Theory - Working Directory, Staging Area (Index) and Repository explained</p></li><li><p>Creating Git Repositories</p></li><li><p>Working with <strong>Commits</strong></p></li><li><p>Understanding <strong>Branches</strong></p></li><li><p>Understanding the HEAD and the <strong>detached HEAD</strong></p></li><li><p>Newly Introduced Git Commands with <strong>Git Version 2.23</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Deleting Data</strong> (Staged &amp; Unstaged, Commits &amp; Branches)</p></li><li><p>Ignoring Files</p></li><li><p>The Stash</p></li><li><p>Merging, Rebasing and <strong>Cherry Picking</strong></p></li><li><p>Bringing Back Deleted Data with the <strong>Reflog</strong></p></li><li><p>Connecting Local Git Repositories to Remote GitHub Repositories</p></li><li><p>Git Push &amp; Pull (+ Fetch)</p></li><li><p>Local, Remote Tracking &amp; Remote Branches</p></li><li><p>GitHub <strong>Collaborators</strong> &amp; <strong>Contributors</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Forks &amp; Pull Requests</strong></p></li><li><p>GitHub Issues</p></li><li><p>Github Projects</p></li><li><p><strong>and so much more!</strong></p></li></ul><p>All covered, explained and applied in <strong>easy to understand examples</strong> in the course!</p><p>---</p><p><strong>In this course we'll find answers to questions like:</strong></p><p>\"How can I delete my last commit?\"</p><p>\"What is the Stash?\"</p><p>\"What is the difference between a merge and a rebase (and what is cherry-picking actually)?\"</p><p>\"How to bring back a deleted commit?\"</p><p>\"What is the difference between a local tracking branch and a remote tracking branch?\"</p><p>---</p><p>What are you waiting for, jump and board and let's <strong>GIT</strong> started<strong> :)</strong></p>",
